# ML-Supervised-learning-classification
The Problem
* I received a database with data about website visitors, their characteristics, and their decision whether to make a purchase or not.
* Depending on the given data, I was asked to tell, for new visitors, whether a purchase will be made or not.
* I produced my prediction using supervised learning techniques.
